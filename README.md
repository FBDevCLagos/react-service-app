# React service app
This project contains resources used in the development and production of the **React service app**. It's an aggregation of the learning efforts of the Facebook Developer Circle Lagos led by the React Team.

# Project Anatomy.
This react app is generated using the *create-react-app* script and is built solely with Javascript.

# Project's Goal
Build a web app where services can be offered and rendered.

Two categories of users:
- User A renders the service.
- User B finds service.

User A joins/registers the service to be rendered.
User B does not necessarily need to join. He/She only need to get the list of services available around, search for a particular service around and get directions to User A's location.

## Future Goals
User B will be given a link for feedback after being serviced by User A, so we prioritize services with higher ratings. <!-- Others will be stated here -->

# Installing.
To install and run app, use the command below.
```sh
npm i && npm run start
```
